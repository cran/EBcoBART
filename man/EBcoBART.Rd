\usage{
EBcoBART(
  Y,
  X,
  model,
  CoData,
  nIter = 10,
  EB_k = FALSE,
  EB_alpha = FALSE,
  EB_sigma = FALSE,
  Prob_Init = c(rep(1/ncol(X), ncol(X))),
  verbose = FALSE,
  ndpost = 5000,
  nskip = 5000,
  nchain = 5,
  keepevery = 1,
  ntree = 50,
  alpha = 0.95,

  sigquant = 0.75
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y}{Response variable that can be either continuous or binary.
Should be a numeric.}

\item{X}{Explanatory variables. Should be a matrix. If X is a data.frame and
contains factors, you may consider the function Dat_EBcoBART}

\item{model}{What type of response variable Y. Can be either continuous or
binary}

\item{CoData}{The co-data model matrix with co-data information on
explanatory variables in X. Should be a matrix, so not a data.frame.
If grouping information is present, please encode this yourself using dummies
with dummies representing which group a explanatory variable belongs to.
The number of rows of the co-data matrix should equal the number of columns
of X. If no CoData is available, but one aims to estimate either prior para-
meter k, alpha or sigma, please specify CoData == NULL.}

\item{nIter}{Number of iterations of the EM algorithm}

\item{EB_k}{Logical (T/F). If true, the EM algorithm also estimates prior
parameter k (of leaf node parameter prior). Defaults to False.
Setting to true increases computational time.}

\item{EB_alpha}{Logical (T/F). If true, the EM algorithm also estimates prior
parameter alpha (of tree structure prior). Defaults to False.
Setting to true increases computational time.}

\item{EB_sigma}{Logical (T/F). If true, the EM algorithm also estimates prior
parameters of the error variance. To do so, the algorithm estimates
the degrees of freedom (sigdf) and the quantile (sigest) at which sigquant
of the probability mass is placed. Thus, the specified sigquant is kept fixed
and sigdf and sigest are updated. Defaults to False.}

\item{Prob_Init}{Initial vector of splitting probabilities for
explanatory variables X. #' Length should equal number of columns of X
(and number of rows in CoData).
Defaults to 1/p, i.e. equal weight for each variable.}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Asks whether algorithm progress
should be printed. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{ndpost}{Number of posterior samples returned by dbarts after burn-in.
Same as in dbarts. Defaults to 5000.}

\item{nskip}{Number of burn-in samples. Same as in dbarts. Defaults to 5000.}

\item{nchain}{Number of independent mcmc chains. Same as in dbarts.
Defaults to 5.}

\item{keepevery}{Thinning. Same as in dbarts. Defaults to 1.}

\item{ntree}{Number of trees in the BART model. Same as in dbarts.
Defaults to 50.}

\item{alpha}{Alpha parameter of tree structure prior. Called base in dbarts.
Defaults to 0.95.
If EB_alpha is TRUE, this parameter will be the starting value.}

\item{beta}{Beta parameter of tree structure prior. Called power in dbarts.
Defaults to 2.}

\item{k}{Parameter for leaf node parameter prior. Same as in dbarts.
Defaults to 2. If EB_k is TRUE, this parameter will be the starting value.}

\item{sigest}{Only for continuous response. Estimate of error variance
used to set scaled inverse Chi^2 prior on error variance. Same as in dbarts.
Defaults to 0.667*var(Y). #' If EB_sigma is TRUE, this parameter will be the
starting value.}

\item{sigdf}{Only for continuous response. Degrees of freedom for error
variance prior. Same as in dbarts. Defaults to 10. If EB_sigma is TRUE,
this parameter will be the starting value.}

\item{sigquant}{Only for continuous response. Quantile at which sigest is
placed Same as in dbarts. Defaults to 0.75. If EB_sigma is TRUE,
this parameter will be fixed, only sigdf and sigest will be updated.}
}
\value{
An object with the estimated variable weights,
i.e the probabilities that variables are selected in the splitting rules.
Additionally, the final co-data model is returned. If EB is set to TRUE,
estimates of k and/or alpha and/or (sigdf, sigest) are also returned.
The returned object is of class S3 for which print() and summary() are
available
The prior parameter estimates can then be used in your favorite BART R
package that supports manually setting the splitting variable
probability vector (dbarts and BARTMachine).
}
\description{
Function that estimates the prior probabilities of variables being selected
in the splitting rules of Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART).
Estimation is performed using empirical Bayes and co-data, i.e. external
information on the explanatory variables.
